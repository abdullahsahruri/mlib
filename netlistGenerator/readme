# Random Width Variation Netlist Generator

## Overview
This script generates netlists with varying MOSFET widths based on a specified subset of width values. The widths of all MOSFETs in the netlist are randomly selected from the subset for each generated netlist.

## Usage

1. **Requirements**:
    - Python 3.x

2. **Running the Script**:
    - Make the script executable:
      ```bash
      chmod +x generate_netlists.py
      ```
    - Run the script:
      ```bash
      ./generate_netlists.py
      ```
    - The script will generate 10 `.sp` files by default. Each file will have randomly varied MOSFET widths.

3. **Customization**:
    - You can modify the subset of widths in the script by changing the `widths` array.
    - Adjust the number of netlists to generate by modifying the `num_files` argument in the `generate_random_widths_netlists()` function call.

## Output
The generated netlists are named as `DFFX1_0.sp`, `DFFX1_1.sp`, ..., `DFFX1_9.sp`, each containing randomly assigned MOSFET widths.

## Example

Example command to run the script:
```bash
./generate_netlists.py
